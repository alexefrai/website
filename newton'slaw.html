    <h1>Newton's First Law</h1>
    <p>An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force</p>
    <h2>Two Clauses and a Condition</h2>
    <p>There are two clauses or parts to this statement - one that predicts the behavior of stationary objects and the other that predicts the behavior of moving objects. The two parts are summarized in the following diagram.</p>

    <p>The behavior of all objects can be described by saying that objects tend to "keep on doing what they're doing" (unless acted upon by an unbalanced force).
        If at rest, they will continue in this same state of rest. If in motion with an eastward velocity of 5 m/s, they will continue in this same state of motion (5 m/s, East).
        If in motion with a leftward velocity of 2 m/s, they will continue in this same state of motion (2 m/s, left).
        The state of motion of an object is maintained as long as the object is not acted upon by an unbalanced force.
        All objects resist changes in their state of motion - they tend to "keep on doing what they're doing."
    </p>
    <h2>Everyday Applications of Newton's First Law</h2>
    <p> There are many applications of Newton's first law of motion. Consider some of your experiences in an automobile. 
        Have you ever observed the behavior of coffee in a coffee cup filled to the rim while starting a car from rest or while bringing a car to rest from a state of motion? Coffee "keeps on doing what it is doing." 
        When you accelerate a car from rest, the road provides an unbalanced force on the spinning wheels to push the car forward; yet the coffee (that was at rest) wants to stay at rest.
        While the car accelerates forward, the coffee remains in the same position; subsequently, the car accelerates out from under the coffee and the coffee spills in your lap. 
        On the other hand, when braking from a state of motion the coffee continues forward with the same speed and in the same direction, ultimately hitting the windshield or the dash. 
        Coffee in motion stays in motion.
